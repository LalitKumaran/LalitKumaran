# Hello World, I'm Lalit! 👋 

I am a passionate Web Developer and a budding Data Scientist. I am pursuing my Bachelor’s of Engineering in Computer Science from Kongu Engineering College and also pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science and Programming from IIT Madras. I am a ambitious person, which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions a lot, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.
