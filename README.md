# Hello World, I'm Lalit! 👋 

I am a passionate web developer and a budding Data scientist. I am pursuing my Bachelor’s of Engineering in Computer Science from Kongu Engineering College and also pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science and Programming from IIT Madras. I am a naturally curious person, which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions a lot, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things.
